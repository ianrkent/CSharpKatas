Rules
* X always goes first.
* Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board until either:
* One player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally

All nine squares are filled.
If a player is able to draw three Xs or three Os in a row, that player wins.
If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
